# GOLF IS HARD

## Motivation
As weekend golfer I try to stay postive when Iâ€™m playing 18 holes because I know golf is hard. Golf will test your patience, require phyiscal precision and all while battling the  outdoor elements. I have noticed my fellow golfers tend to have too high of expectations for their rounds leaving them frustrated after their rounds. I wanted to look into the differences between pro golfers and amateur golfers. Amateurs tend to have too high of expecations and get should be proud of some shots and putts they make during their round when compared to the tour players.

## Questions:
1) How difficult are the courses played on the PGA Tour vs amateur courses?
2) How much further do the pros drive the ball vs the amateurs?
3) Why do the pros shoot better scores than amateurs?
4) What shots should amateurs be proud of because they hit the ball as close to the pin as the tour average?
5) What should amateurs practice to be more like the pros and have more fun?

## Normalizing the Data
PGA Tour data is easily available and very through and has several years of data collected. I decided to use the 2022-2023 season as it was the most recent season of data that was completed. I had to be selective of the stats used from the PGA based on the data I could locate for amateur golfers to make them comparable.  

## Problems and Hurdles
The biggest obstacle was locating enough amateur data to help answer the questions I had. Arccos has the largest database of amateur golf data but is a private company and does not realease all of the stats they have. With enough searaching I was able to find golf instructors that have access to the Arccos data and release some of that information across different mediums.

## Technologies Used
1) Python / Pandas - for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the datasets
2) Power BI - for creating interactive dashboard
3) PowerPoint - for introduction of Project and incorporation of Power BI dashboards
4) Git - for version control

## Data Sources
To answer the above questions I used the following sources to collect datasets for my analysis

## Conclusion
The data analysis shows that professional golfers are paid well to perform for a reason. They are very skilled at what they do compared to the hobbyist golfers. While amatuers may never be able to hit the golf ball as far or as consistent at the pros there are some takeaways that would greatly improve their rounds. Amateur golfers should be excited about shots they get anywhere near the green and pin because the PGA Tour averages are not as good as you think when you watch a tournament on television.
